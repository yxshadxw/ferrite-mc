//! Ferrite's entity system.
//!
//! - [`EntityStore`]: per-region storage. Generational keys over dense structure-of-arrays
//!   columns for the hot fields (position, velocity, bounding box, flags) plus a dense column
//!   of everything else, and a chunk-section index ([`SectionIndex`]) for range and collision
//!   queries.
//! - [`tracker`]: the vanilla entity tracker, run per region against the region's players.
//! - [`Metadata`]: synched entity data with dirty tracking.
//! - [`item`]: item entities (vanilla physics against block shapes, merging, pickup into a
//!   player inventory, despawning), with [`physics`] underneath.
//! - [`allocate_id`] / [`random_uuid`]: the process-wide network id counter (shared with
//!   players) and entity UUIDs.
//!
//! Threading follows Folia: an entity is only touched by the region that owns its chunk.
//! Stores split and merge with their regions, and an entity that walks into another region
//! section leaves its store by value ([`EntityStore::take_crossing`]) to be handed to the new
//! owner through that region's task queue.
